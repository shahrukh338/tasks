--> You can store any number of objects in a bucket and can have up to 100 buckets in your account
--> While the Standard storage class is designed for 99.99% availability (52m 36s downtime per year), 
    Standard Infrequent Access is designed for 99.9% (8h 45m downtime per year) and 
    One Zone Infrequent Access is designed for 99.5% availability (1d, 19h 49m downtime per year)
--> Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 TB. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 GB.

--> Different types of cloud computing

    There are three main types of cloud computing offered as services by the service providers.

    1.Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) provides basic building blocks such as virtual or dedicated hardware in the form of computers, data storage space as well as 
                            networking access in the form of IT infrastructure on a pay as per use basis to customers eliminating initial and ongoing expenses after
                     purchasing infrastructure, space, and maintenance, but only to focus on business improvement and improving applications built by these companies.
    2.Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers managing hardware and operating systems for the customers and focusing on deploying their products, eliminating initial and 
                                 ongoing expenses after purchasing infrastructure, space, and maintenance.
    3.Software as a Service (SaaS) offers complete management of end-user applications along with management of infrastructure supporting these applications, 
                                   for the companies as their service offerings.

---------------------------------------------Security groups------------

What are security groups in AWS?
A security group acts as a virtual firewall for your EC2 instances to control incoming and outgoing traffic. Inbound rules control the incoming traffic
to your instance, and outbound rules control the outgoing traffic from your instance. When you launch an instance, you can specify one or more security groups.

What are security groups for?
Security groups are used to collect user accounts, computer accounts, and other groups into manageable units. In the Windows Server operating system, 
there are several built-in accounts and security groups that are preconfigured with the appropriate rights and permissions to perform specific tasks

In Amazon Virtual Private Cloud or VPC, your instances are in a private cloud, and you may add up to five AWS security groups per instance. You may add 
or delete inbound and outbound traffic rules. You can also add new groups even after the instance is already running

-------------------------LOAD BALANCERS-----------
Elastic Load Balancing supports the following types of load balancers: Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, and Classic Load Balancers. 
Amazon ECS services can use these types of load balancer. 
--> * Application Load Balancers are used to route HTTP/HTTPS (or Layer 7) traffic. 
--> * Network Load Balancers and Classic Load Balancers are used to route TCP (or Layer 4) traffic.


		1.Application Load Balancer L7
		2.Network Load Balancer L4
		3.Classic Load Balancer
		4.Gateway Load Balancers
