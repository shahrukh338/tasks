MANAGE ROLES:
global roles: it will assign access to overall jenkins server
item roles: it is for particular specified job only. it can override global roles.this is having more access than global roles
	role to add -- id(name) for particular role
	pattern 	  -- perticular job name


ASSIGN ROLES: 
Global Roles: giving roles to the users which are specified(created) in MANAGE ROLES
	user/group to add -- the user/group name which we are created in users session
Item Roles:  by using this we will give particular user to particular job. so he can only access specified jobs. a user/group can have multiple jobs access permission.
	user/group to add -- here we add  user/group who item Roles



-------------------------------------

--> create a user in manage users 
--> manage roles in Manage and assign roles
	- go to ItemRoles and create a Role with job name
       - then Go to Assign Roles
	- in Global roles add user which we created in manage users
	- then In ItemRoles add user and give permissions
