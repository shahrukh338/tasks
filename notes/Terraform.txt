Terraform--(IAC)
main approches
	1.repeatability(ex configurations)
	2.auditability(ex changes visibility and tracking )
	3.collabaration(with any tool like github)

config file

Software Development Life Cycle:
requirements(docker,k8s,vm etc)--> design(os, platform etc)--> implementation(IAC)--> Infra Testing-->Deployment--> maintainance(if anything happened wrong then we do changes with terraform)

-->  Terraform is Cli tool we dont have GUI for Terraform
-->* Terraform is the Declarative IAC
-->  it always make sure that what ever we declared configurations it will check either it is running or not
	if we delete statefile then it will delete VM also
statefile(it is like database, what ever we create resources, it will stored data in this statefile)
	statefile and configfile should always match
-->



What is Terraform?
-Terraform is a tool for building ,changing,Versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently
-Enables application software best practices to infrastructure
-Compatible with many clouds and services
-Terraform is IaC( Infrastructure as Code)

Categories in infa as a code.
1)Ad hoc script
2) config management tools
3)server templating tools
4)orchestration tools
5)Provisioning tools
5.1) Declarative - we say i want a EC2,Load balance ,etc
5.2) Imperitive - we say the system what we want to happen and what sequence

cloud specific vs cloud Agnostics

Cloud specific:
Cloud Formation - Aws own service for IaC it can be accessable only in aws,and only allow provisioning in only aws cloud

Cloud agnostics: 
It can be used to access any cloud provider
