Solution
Luckily for us, we can update the permissions with the help of some simple chmod commands.

If we want our private key to be readable by the logged in user, we will use the following command:

chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
If we want our private key to be both readable and writable by the logged in user, we will use this command instead:

chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa



Fix:
Change the permissions of the ~/.ssh/id_rsa file after creation to 0600.
